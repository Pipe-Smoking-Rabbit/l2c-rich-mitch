# For Loops!!!
[mdn documentation here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)

A for loop has 3 parts:
+ **Start** - how to begin
+ **Stop** - where to end
+ **Step** - how to increment

```
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    console.log(i)
}
```


>*Start* - Instantiates the value of `i` to begin the process
> 
>>`let i = 0`
>
>*Stop* - lets the for loop know at what value of `i` to end the loop
>
>>`i < 4`
>
>*Step* - how much to increase the value of `i` for each iteration
>
>>`i++`

***

The above example will output to the terminal:

```
0
1
2
3
```
